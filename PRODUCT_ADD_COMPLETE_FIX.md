## Debugging - If It Doesn't Work

### Open Browser Console (F12 → Console Tab)

#### Look for These Success Logs:
```
handleAddProduct called with data: {...}
Uploading images...
Submitting product to server...
ProductApi: Response received: {...}
```

#### Common Error Messages & Solutions:

**Error: "Missing required fields: category"**
- **Solution**: Make sure to SELECT from the Category dropdown (not just type)

**Error: "Missing required fields: condition"**
- **Solution**: Make sure to SELECT from the Condition dropdown

**Error: "Missing required fields: brand"**
- **Solution**: Select a brand from autocomplete or type a new one

**Error: "Error uploading thumbnail image"**
- **Solution**: Try a smaller image file or a different format (PNG, JPG)

**Network Error (No Response)**
- **Solution**: 
  1. Check if backend is running: `http://localhost:8000`
  2. Open terminal and see backend console for errors
  3. Check if port 8000 is in use

### Backend Console Output

When you click "Add Product", the backend should log:
```
Create product request received with body: {...}
Using existing brand: ObjectId
Using existing category: ObjectId
Product created successfully: ObjectId
```

If you see errors, look for:
```
Error creating product: [error details here]
Missing fields: [list of missing fields]
```
